# Rhino-3D-Alias-Shortcuts
A custom set of Rhino3D v6 Alias shortcuts based upon the Maxwan AutoCAD shortcuts and the on @DarrelDonald aliases.

These roughly 215 shortcuts have been developed by Christina Krampokouki and Jan Cyganski based on @DarrelRonald. Rhinoceros aliases can be used to make command scripts smaller by substituting a word for a whole macro or part of a macro. It drastically speeds up your drawing. If you want to add new Aliases, you can refer to the weblink below.

Installation
Navigate in Rhino3D to Tools > Options > Aliases > and then import the .TXT file in the repository. You should overwrite all existing alises, since you can always Restore Defaults later.
The Excel file in the repository is an alphabetized overview of the aliases for easier learning.
